However, there is a lack of confidence and tone in their delivery, which could be improved to engage the audience better. To enhance their overall communication style, the candidate should work on increasing confidence levels and infusing more energy and enthusiasm into their speech. This can be achieved through practice, such as rehearsing in front of a mirror or recording mock interviews to identify areas of improvement.",
